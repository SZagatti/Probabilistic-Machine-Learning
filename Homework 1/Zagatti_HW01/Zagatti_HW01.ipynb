In general we have that for any positive integer $m$ we can place $m$ points on a circle, then if we consider any subset of the points we can build a convex polytope using those points as the extreme points (vertices of the polygons). With this construction we have that the polytope will not contain any of the points not in the subset, this proves that we can shatter arbitrarily large sets, so the VC dimension is infinite.\n",

In general we have that for this class we can shatter $2d+1$ points. This can be proved by placing $2d+1$ points on a circle and labeling them with two classes: positive (1) and negative (0). Since we have an odd number of points there will be a majority in one of the classes.\n",
